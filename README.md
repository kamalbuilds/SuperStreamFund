# Problems aimed to Solve
Interoperability: By leveraging different blockchain networks, SuperStreamFund application can facilitate the transfer of funds between different cryptocurrencies, making it easier for users to contribute to projects regardless of the cryptocurrency they hold.

Accessibility: SuperStreamFund can increase accessibility to crowdfunding by allowing users to contribute with different cryptocurrencies, lowering the barriers to entry for those who may not have the same currency as the platform.

Security: Blockchain-based crowdfunding is inherently more secure, as the funds are held in smart contracts that are transparent and tamper-proof. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the blockchain network means that the funds are not held by a centralized authority, reducing the risk of fraud or other malicious activities.

Transparency: Smart contracts on the blockchain provide a high level of transparency, enabling contributors to track the progress of the project and the allocation of funds in real-time. This increases trust and accountability between the project owner and contributors.

Global reach: SuperStreamFund has the potential to reach a global audience, as the platform is not tied to a particular country or jurisdiction, making it easier to raise funds from a diverse pool of contributors around the world.

# Xapp Nested calls using Connext

Multiple blockchain support: SuperStreamFund can use nested xcalls to interact with different blockchain networks to facilitate cross-chain transactions. 
When a user backs a campaign with cryptocurrency, the application can initiate a nested xcall to transfer the funds to the project owner's wallet on a different blockchain network. 
This can be especially useful if the project owner prefers to receive payments on a specific blockchain network.
